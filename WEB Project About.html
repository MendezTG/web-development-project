                <!-- first paragraph-->
                <p>My name is Anthony Mendez, but most people call me Tony. I am from Dalton Georgia and I moved to Marietta last fall to finish my last two years of college here at KSU. I have learned a lot about my experience of being away from home, it has been hard but I feel very free and happier now that I am on my own. </p>
                <!-- second paragraph-->
                <p>I have experience in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I have been working on and off with Adobe for a few years, but it is something I enjoy doing in my free time. I also now have novice experience with HTML and CSS and I am getting more and more comfortable as the semester goes on. </p>
                <p>My goals are to graduate from KSU and find a good-paying job where I can focus on my hobbies, which include Photoshop and learning new instruments. I also would like to travel more to places like Asia and Europe.</p>
